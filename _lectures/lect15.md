# Announcements
* As announced reepeatedly, this week's lab will be taken up by the **group peer-evaluation** [lab08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/f21/lab/lab08/), so make sure to finish all points for lab06 (part2) before Section starts, and for lab07 before the end of tthe day, Friday. 
* **Code Freeze** for your projects will be two weeks later, **Friday, Dec. 3rd, with Thanksgiving break in between, next week, Friday, 11/26**!
* Project presentations will take place, as long announced and planned, during the final exam slot, **Dec. 6th, 4-7pm**.
* All documentation and the presentation video will be due at the end of **Wednesday, December 8th**. 

Here, again, is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade:

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual 

# End User Evaluation

You will likely not have time to conduct your own independent end user evaluation (prove us wrong if you do!), but this week's peer group evaluation will be a step in that direction

# Today (or at your schedule): Third and Last Retrospective

This is one of your last major opportunities to inspect and adapt on your path toward the goal line!
This week's lab there will be our peer evaluation where another team tests your deployment instructions and current state product, and then there is two more weeks of development until code freeze! 

You already know the goal and procedure for Retrospectives from your previous retros. This Retrospective allows you to discuss things that are important to get to the best team productivity in this critical final final stretch to product deployment, documentation, and presentation.

* In your team's repo, under `team/retrospectives` directory, add a file `RETRO_03.md` capturing the following:

  ```
  # Retro #3 <date>

  * Led by: name-goes-here
  * Present: name1, name2, ... , nameN
  * Absent: name1, name2, ...

  ## Action item

  * a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  * a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
  * a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

  ## Optional

  * Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

  ```

* After the Retro
  
  Retro leader: add the following Section to `RETRO_03.md`:
  
  ```
  ## Retro Assessment

  * A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  * A brief assessment of how it went.
  * A brief statement on how much any of the Retros changed the way you worked as a team (no correct answer here. 
    Teams could be happy with the way they started operating from the get-go and Retrospectives would just be quick 
    confirmations then, or teams could have tried a lot of different things based on their retro reviews. We just would like to know!)
