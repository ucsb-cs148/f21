# Final Presentations

Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the TAs and I plan to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

15% Presentation
5% Idea, and Idea Refinement
25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish)
15% Technical Difficulty Implemented
20% Implementation

We will cross-reference against both an initial quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators, and against a ranking stemming from peer-review
