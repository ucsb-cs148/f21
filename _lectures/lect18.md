# Announcements
* Full focus on finalizing your product! 

* Last CATME survey results were released to you Tue morning.

* [Lab09](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/f21/lab/lab09/) has more deadlines coming up: 
    * **Friday, 12/04** (Code Freeze, Final Code Release)
    * **Monday, December 6th, 4-7pm**: Project presentations (10 minutes per team plus up-to-5-minute probing & Q&A)
    * **Wednesday, 12/08** (Documentation of Team Roles and Github Contributions, a "Lessons Learned" post, Audience Choice Award voting). Also: all final project documents are due at this time! 
      


* Quick summary of the purpose/scope of the different documents: 
    * Design Document (final version due Wed, 12/08): You started this document with your overall software diagram during Lab06. During Lab07, you expanded it. We had recommended the following Sections then: 
        * Opening/Overview section with high-level system architecture overview diagram for your project, with associated explanations of all parts in some text paragraphs accompanying it.
        * More Detailed SW Architecture Design: Describe the main modules in your SW Design in more detail
        * Design Process Documentation Section: Document your design process by summarizing important team decisions referring to specific meetings logged in your GitHub repo.
        * User Interface and User Experience (UX) considerations. Your high-level task/user flow from Lab07 might be the first thing to document here. Document iterations/testing as you see fit. 
         

    Overall, this document guides a Developer or Teaching Team Member through your decisions and process for arriving at your final product. 
    
    * Manual (final version due Wed, 12/08): User Manual, oriented towards end user, not developer, not instructor. Via screen shots and explanatory text explains the functionality of the product and provides a "how-to" instruction manual. Format: PDF or Google Doc. You can (but don't have to) link to videos. You started this document during Lab07.  

    * Documentation of Team Roles and Github Contributions (part of Lab09 requirements, also due Wed, 12/08): brief summary of individual team member contributions in `team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md` to provide context to our inspection of your Kanban boards and GitHub activity.

    * Full finalized deployment instructions `docs/DEPLOY.md` within your repo (also due Wed, 12/08)
      


* For our grading criteria, please see the [page on your final presentations](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/f21/exam/project_presentations/)!


# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

The ESCI course evaluation system will be due on **Friday, December 03, 23:59:59**

Response rate as of 12:00pm, Wed 12/01/2021:

| Course ID |	Enrollment Count	|Surveys Completed	|Percent Completed|
|-|-|-|-|
| CMPSC 148 	| 54	| 11 |	20.37% |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}
 
So please fill in your evaluations!

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs). I would like to also ask you to please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the quality of the instructor's teaching (Question A) and the overall quality of the course (Question B).

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time (especially after so many peer eval questionnaires! :))  

# Final Thoughts

I have been **really pleased** with what we've been seeing in your groups.

Here's the course description for CS148, turned into a bullet list:

> Team-based project development. Topics include 
>
> * software engineering and professional development practices, 
> * techniques for team-oriented design and development
> * testing and test-driven development
> * advanced library support
> * software reliability and robustness
> * interface design 
>
> Students present and demonstrate final projects.

Note that "web development" isn't even on the list; we learned some of that, but that was a *means to an end*.

We've touched on all of the topics in the list, admittedly emphasizing some more than others.

Where I see some real mastery is:
* **professional development practices**
* **team oriented design and development**

We hear you talking about different feature branches and pull requests, QA and production, front-end and back-end, issues, acceptance criteria and your kanban board. 

We no longer see "student teams".  What we hear are the sounds of software industry professionals at work.

I'm really proud of what we've accomplished this quarter.  I hope you are too.
