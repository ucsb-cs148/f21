* [Lab09](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/f21/lab/lab09/) starts today, has deadlines on **Monday Nov 29** (CATME survey), **Friday, 12/04** (Final Code Release), and **Wednesday, 12/08** (Documentation of Team Roles and Github Contributions, a "Lessons Learned" post, Audience Choice Award voting).


# Remaining Schedule Reminder: 

* **Code Freeze** for your projects will be end of the day this Friday: **Friday, December 4th**!
* Project presentations will take place, as long announced and planned, during the final exam slot, **Monday, December 6th, 4-7pm**.
* All documentation and the presentation video will be due at the end of **Wednesday, December 8th**. 


Here, again, is the class grading scheme including the agreed-upon point percentage breakdown for grading the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade:

* 25% Homeworks (drop lowest three)
* 35% Lab Points (including lab09)
* 40% your final project 

Final Project Grading Dimensions: 

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual 

# Briefly: Some Lessons Learned

In our teaching team meetings, the staff share some of the lessons learned. We ask you to think of some as well, so that we will have some collective wisdom for future iterations of this class. 
A few examples to stir your imagination: 

* During a rebase, *just rebase*.  Don't make changes (i.e. fix bugs, add features) during a rebase.  Only focus on 
  fixing merge conflicts.    Make your changes to fix bugs or add features before the rebase, or after the rebase,
  but *not during*.
  
* Making sure to listen to your team mates and give everyone a chance to feel like they are a part of the team, because the internal team work and how everyone contributes is crucial to the team's effectiveness and success. 
  
Let's take a moment: what are some other lessons you've learned this quarter?  Please type them type them into the `#lessons_learned` channel in Slack!   


# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

The ESCI course evaluation system is open NOW until **Friday, December 03, 23:59:59**. 

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs). I would like to also ask you to please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the quality of the instructor's teaching (Question A) and the overall quality of the course (Question B).

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time (especially after so many peer eval questionnaires! :))
