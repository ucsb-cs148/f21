# Procedure for First Retro

You may or may not have done an official `Sprint Review` meeting yet. In a way, you are doing those via your check-ins with your mentors and that is sufficient in a cinch, but we encourage you to hold and log official Sprint Review meetings at the end of each of your Sprints. In any case, you should have enough information about what worked and didn't work in your Sprint(s) so far (and from your homeworks) to hold your first Retrospective meeting today! 

# Today: Retrospective

* We'll put you in breakout groups.
* When you are finished with the Retrospective, you are free to coordinate further as a group towards your MVP, or just leave.
  * No need to come back to main room, unless you have questions 
* Staff will be dropping in to observe.

# Deliverable  

* Add to your team's repo, under `team` directory a folder called `retrospectives`
* Create a file `team/retrospectives/RETRO_01.md`


* Add the following information:

  ```
  # Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

  * Led by: name-goes-here
  * Present: name1, name2, ... , nameN
  * Absent: name1, name2, ...

  ## Action item

  * a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  * a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
  * a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

  ## Optional

  * Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

  ```

 
* After the Retro
  
  **Retro leader**: add Section to `team/retrospectives/RETRO_01.md`
  
  ```
  ## Retro Assessment

  * A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  * A brief assessment of how it went.
  * What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
    based on what you learned today?
