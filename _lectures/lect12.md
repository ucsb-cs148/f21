# Announcements
* [Homework assignment h08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/hwk/h08/) on SW Design Patterns posted. Due next Tuesday. 
* Still **focus on your projects**. Lab work on documentation (**design document**, **user manual**) is meant to get you started and to utilize cycles of team members not central to ongoing implementation efforts at any given time. 
* Difference of **README.md** and **design document**: 
    * The README.md describes the GitHub structure and folder hierarchy and makes sure a programmer can make sense of it. It now should **link** to the deployment instructions. 
    * The Design Document does not need to directly relate to the repository or to deployment details. It operates on a higher level: Overall SW architecture, modules, and their interaction. It also contains the UX design documentation... 
* Deployment instructions will be really important for the **group peer-evaluation** next week [lab08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lab/lab08/). 
* **Code Freeze** for your projects will be a week later, **Friday, June 4th**!
* All documentation and the presentation video will be due at the end of **Tuesday, June 8th**. 
* Project presentations will take place, as long announced and planned, during the final exam slot, **June 10th, 4-7pm**.

Here, again, is the now agreed-upon point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade:

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual
