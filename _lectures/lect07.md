# Final Presentations 

**4pm to 7pm, Monday December 6th** (original finals slot)

Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual 

We will cross-reference against both an initial quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators, and against a ranking stemming from peer-review

# Continuous Integration / Continouous Delivery (CI/CD) 

* **Continuous Delivery**: Software development process that aims to build software that is *always* ready to be deployed into production
* **Continuous Integration**: Technique where every developer on a project should integrate their work daily with every other developer
