# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

You are likely getting many reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs). I would like to also remind you to please take a moment before the deadline on **Friday June 4th** to enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the quality of instructor's teaching (Question A) and the overall quality of the course (Question B).

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Response rate as of noon 06/03/2020:

| Course ID |	Enrollment Count	|Surveys Completed	|Percent Completed|
|-|-|-|-|
| CMPSC 148 	| 39	| 11 |	28.21% |

So **please, please, please** fill in your evaluations!

# Final Thoughts

I have been **really pleased** with what I've been seeing when I stop in your groups.

Here's the course description for CS148, turned into a bullet list:

> Team-based project development. Topics include 
>
> * software engineering and professional development practices, 
> * techniques for team-oriented design and development
> * testing and test-driven development
> * advanced library support
> * software reliability and robustness
> * interface design 
>
> Students present and demonstrate final projects.

Note that "web development" isn't on the list; we learned some of that, but that was a *means to an end*.

We've touched on all of the topics in the list, admittedly emphasizing some more than others.

Where I see some real mastery is:
* **professional development practices**
* **team oriented design and development**

I pop in on breakout rooms and I hear you talking about different feature branches and pull requests, QA and production, front-end and back-end, issues, acceptance criteria and your kanban board. 

I no longer hear "student teams".  What I hear is the sounds of software industry professionals at work.

I'm really proud of what we've accomplished this quarter.  I hope you are too.


# Remaining Schedule Reminder:

# Today: Final Lab, Final Push 

* Standup 
* Now Lab09 Credit :) :  One "I wish I had known it when I started" lesson learned posted in #lessons_learned Slack channel. Examples: 
    * During a rebase, *just rebase*.  Don't make changes (i.e. fix bugs, add features) during a rebase.  Only focus on 
      fixing merge conflicts.    Make your changes to fix bugs or add features before the rebase, or after the rebase,
      but *not during*.
    * Making sure to listen to your team mates and give everyone a chance to feel like they are a part of the team, because the internal team work and how everyone contributes is crucial to the   
      team's effectiveness and success. 
    * The `git bisect` tool [can help you figure out](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) with what commit you introduced a crucial change in your repository. 
 
* Work towards Code Freeze and Release.
