# Code Freeze 

By this deadline, you should have reviewed and accepted your final pull request of the quarter for any new development or other GitHub content.
Also, the Deployment Instructions linked from your README.md are in their final form.  

After this deadline, you
* should NOT be adding or turning on new features
* should NOT be doing major refactorings

Permitted, with mentor approval, very occasional, a **reasonable** number of:
* Small bug fixes (bugs that went unnoticed until final demoing)
* Minor fixes to style issues

Those changes, if any, should be ones that are easy to review and understand, and each should be in its own separate pull request.
