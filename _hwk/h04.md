Once again, visit this web page

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>

If the web page should happen to be unreachable, please visit its web archive entry:

* https://web.archive.org/web/20200104185532/https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/

For this assignment, we will return to the following sections on that page, but this time, we will also follow the links to
the first tab, the  [*Agile Manifesto*](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/).

* What is Agile?
* What is Agile Software Development?
* A Short History of Agile

Read those sections, and pages linked to by the keywords *Agile Manifesto*.  Reading the *12 principles* may also help, but those will be a focus of a future assignment.

Then answer the questions on this Gradescope assignment: <{{page.gradescope}}>
