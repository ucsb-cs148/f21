Read the material at the following web page. It's relatively short.  
For the assignment, just this page&mdash;you don't need to follow each link (I'll let you know which links you need to follow and read below.)
* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>
You can also find an overview of Scrum methodology in this excellent little summary handbook (available only to class participants, hence password protected:)
* <https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/Scrum.pdf>

You should read these sections on that page.  For this assignment, you do not need to follow the links to the values, 
twelve principles, or the Agile Manifesto.

* What is Agile?
* What is Agile Software Development?
* A Short History of Agile

Also read the brief definitions of first four of the seven key Agile concepts listed, and follow and read the material linked for each of these four.  Each is brief.  (We'll do the next three on a future homework.)
* User Stories
* Daily Meeting (a.k.a. Standup, Scrum)
   * Follow the link to "The Three Questions"
* Incremental Development
* Iterative Development
