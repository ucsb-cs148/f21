Once again, visit this web page

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>

If the web page is unreachable, there is a [web archive entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200104185532/https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

For this assignment, we will:
* Go to the right hand side of the page under Key Agile Concepts,
* read the item labelled "Milestone Retrospective"
* Follow the link to the detailed page about the "Milestone Retrospective" (where it says "More...") **and**
* Also follow these links from the Milestone Retrospective page:
   * Iteration Retrospective
   * Facilitated Meeting

Then, familiarize yourself with the following page as well.  There are many links on that page, and it won't be necessary to follow and read all of them, but you will need some of them to answer the questions on this homework:

* <https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/topics/retros/>

With that reading done, answer the questions on this assignment on Gradescope:
