# Demo 

Final project presentations will start on  {{ page.demo_date_1 }}.  *All groups should be ready to present on this date.*
Groups that volunteer will be scheduled first.  After that, the order will be randomized.   

Final project presentations will continue on {{ page.demo_date_2 }}, and finish up on  {{ page.demo_date_3 }}.

Grading for this assignment will focus on the effectiveness of the demonstrations, not the projects per se.

Other groups' members *are expected to attend* and ask questions and provide helpful
comments.

# Instructions for presenters

Demonstrations will take place in the usual lecture room.

The task is to briefly, but completely show the class what your system does.

If the nature of your system prevents you from running it in the lecture room in such
a way that it can be displayed by the projector (either using the lectern PC or by
plugging in your laptop) then you must find another way to demonstrate it for the
entire class to see. Holding up a phone, tablet or laptop is not good enough! Creating a video
of the program running is okay, for example, or preparing a Powerpoint presentation with
screenshots of the running program is another possible solution.

There is no need for a group presentation.  If one member can adequately demonstrate
the system, that is okay. All group members should attend though, to lend
support and to witness the demonstrations of other groups.

However, *all* group members also should be prepared to
answer questions from the instructor and/or TA about how to interact with your system.
   
Presentations/demos should be between 7 and 8 minutes (they will be timed and you will be graded on hitting this duration, so make sure and practice).

# Instructions for participation by non-presenters

All students are expected to attend *all demonstrations* even if your group has already presented.  You should give these presentations your full attention.  Here are some reasons why:

* There may be **a homework assignment** based on answering questions about the presentations on the days you did not present.  

* There may be **questions on the final exam** that ask you about presentations from the days that you did not attend.  For example, I may give you a list of presentations from each day.  I will then ask you to choose a presentation from the day your group did NOT present, and ask you some questions about that group's project&mdash;questions that anyone who attended the presentation should be able to answer.  If you miss a day when your group is not presenting, be sure that someone from your group that your trust is there to take good notes, and share with you a synopsis of what you missed.

We encourage your comments and/or questions for the presenters as well.
