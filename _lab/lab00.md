# Announcements

* Teaching Team Introduction
* Please fill out the [Student Survey](https://bit.ly/tba) (required for enrolled students) 

# "Open Lab Hours"

* We have two TAs: Alan Roddick 
* We have one Reader: Wei-Yee Goh
* There are currently two Learning Assistants: Bryan Terce, Vincent Tieu
* We have two Lab Sections: Fri, 11am PDT and noon PDT. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours
where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.
  
# Goals

* You'll meet several of your classmates that you haven't met before
* You'll get a first idea of what this class is about
