# Team

* We have two TAs: Alan Roddick and Nagarjun Avaraddy
* We have one Reader: Wei-Yee Goh
* There are currently two Learning Assistants: Bryan Terce, Vincent Tieu, and we are trying to add more... 
* We have two Lab Sections: Fri, 11am PDT and noon PDT. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours
where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.
