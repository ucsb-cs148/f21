# One week to MVP. Please prepare: 
## Planning your demo (MVP video)

* Plan a five minute presentation video
* Please prepare a 5 minute YouTube video (unlisted or public, your choice)
  - See the bottom of the [lab02](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lab/lab02/) description for information about creating your MVP video.
  - Links to videos will be made available to (some of) the class for peer review, but will not be made public
* Present to an audience of **potential users**
  - Not to an audience of CS148 students, or the instructor or TAs.
  - Explain what problem the app solves, or what need it fulfills, as you demo the features of
    the app.
* Stay focused on user functionality.
  - Do not go into details of implementation, or team process.
  - There will be other presentations for that.
* Optionally, you may introduce with a powerpoint slide, and/or close with one, but the bulk
  of the time, you should be sharing your screen and showing us your app.
* At the end, tell us a bit about upcoming features planned for the next iteration.

At or after next week's (week 5) lab session you'll be asked to evaluate other teams' presentation(s), so plan to watch them and be ready to do some very brief writing after each one.

## Point us to your video
*  create a file `team/MVP_DEMO.md` containing your MVP video link and any additional information you see fit that you think doesn't belong in the project's README.md  

## Add the following information to your README.md:

> TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch).
> Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), you can run GitHub Actions locally).

> and showcase your features.

> 
> TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
> Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.
> 
> ## Contributing

> TODO: Leave the steps below if you want others outside your team to contribute to your project.
> 
> 1. Fork it!
> 2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
> 3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
> 4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
> 5. Submit a pull request :D
