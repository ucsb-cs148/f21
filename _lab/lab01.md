# Step 1: Create a CoE account if you don't have one already

You could do all the necessary work this quarter on your own computer, but very likely it will be convenient for you to test things with your team on a computer in one of the Computer Science Labs. 

To log on to the machines in the Computer Science labs, or to connect
remotely, you will need a **College of Engineering account**. You can create an account online at
<https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create>.

If you are enrolled in <i>any</i> CoE course this quarter (including CS148), you
should be able to create your account immediately.

If you are not able to do so, you will need to contact the ECI Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@engineering.ucsb.edu">help@engineering.ucsb.edu</a>.
